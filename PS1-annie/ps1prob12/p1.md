## Problem 1 -- What is kernel mode / what is user mode?

Explain for each of the following items whether they can be accomplished entirely within user mode, or require a system call? If the latter, identify what specific system call or calls would be used. If the answer is "it depends," tell me on what it depends!

**a) reading one char from a file on disk using `fgetc`**  
  If the buffering mode is set to Unbuffered, or when the buffer is empty, it will make a system call.

**b) calling a function**  
  If the function is a system call function in disguise, it will be a system call. Otherwise it's fine.

**c)**
```c
struct whack *s = malloc (sizeof *s);
```  
  If the allocated memory is correctly mapped to physical addresses, there will be no system call, otherwise a page fault will be generated, and kernel will try allocating again.

**d) getting the current time of day**  
  It will be a system call.

**e)**
```c
double e = exp(1.0);
```  
  It will not be a system call.
