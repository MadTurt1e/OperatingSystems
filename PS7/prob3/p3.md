**Problem 3EC -- scheduling and niceness**
Write a test program which creates a number of CPU-bound processes. One of those processes will have a non-
default nice value.

```
$ ./nice
Error: wrong arguments
Usage: ./nice [number of children] [niceness] [waittime]
```

In theory the second one should not affect the time that much, but we have a lot of other things running on the machine, our nice child is being bullied by them, and we don't have a lot of spare cores. 

The theory is that we prefer to put the same process onto it's previous cpu because there is cache. And we generally evenly distribute the cores for efficiency. So on our nice child's cpu, there is no competition.
