## Problem 2 -- What happens if...

For each of the following code fragments, tell me "what happens if". Explain your answer as appropriate. For example, if there is a system call error, what specific error and why? If a variable is assigned to, what value winds up in that variable? Youâ€™re allowed to run these examples to see what happens.

**a)**
```c
n=write(1,"XYZ",3);
```  
stdout: XYZ  
n: 3

**b)**
```c
fd=open("/ooopsy",O_WRONLY|O_CREAT|O_TRUNC,0666);
``` 
fd: -1  
error message: Permission denied  
error code: 13

**c)**
```c
char buf[3];
for(;;) 
    printf("%d\n",read(fd,buf,3)); 
    /* fd is a file on disk open for reading; 
    the associated file is 10 bytes long */
```
stdout: 3\n3\n3\n1\n[infinite loop of 0\n]

**d)**
```c
n=write(1,NULL,1);
```  
n: -1  
error message: Bad address  
error code: 14

**e)**
```c
n=close(-1);
```  
n: -1  
error message: Bad file descriptor  
error code: 9
