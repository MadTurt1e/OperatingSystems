**Problem 2 -- Data structure integrity**

The following declaration represents a singly linked list data structure:
```c
struct ll {
    struct ll_elem* head;
    /* And potentially other stuff */
};
struct ll_elem {
    struct ll_elem* fwd;
    int payload;
    /* And potentially other stuff */
};
```

And this is a straightforward function to insert a new element (which has already been allocated) into the linked list
after a given element. If the insert_after parameter is NULL, the new element is inserted at the head of the list.
```c
void ll_insert(struct ll* ll, struct ll_elem* insert_after, struct ll_elem* new_elem) {
    if (!insert_after) {
        new_elem->fwd = ll->head;
        ll->head = new_elem;
    } else {
        new_elem->fwd = insert_after->fwd;
        insert_after->fwd = new_elem;
    }
}
```

A) This function is not safe in a concurrent environment, i.e. where two or more simultaneous and/or overlapping
threads attempt to call the function on the same linked list. Give specific example(s) of what can go wrong. </br>
Say we have 2 simultaneous attempts to call ll_insert on the same linked list. Notably, none of the code segments are "atomic". All the elements would require an insertion into the linked list, than a set to the new value. If we were to, say, call ll_insert twice in a row to insert with the same insert_after element, an issue could occur where only one of the elements get through to be set as the next node, and the other is lost to the symbolic void. 

B) Modify the code above so it is safe for the "STU" case (as defined in the lecture notes and class discussion), i.e.
where we are only concerned with an overlapping signal handler.</br>
An easy way to do this is to just block all signals until we're done. 

```c
#include <signal.h>

void ll_insert(struct ll *ll, struct ll_elem *insert_after, struct ll_elem *new_elem) {
    // block all the signals
    sigset_t oldmask, newmask;
    sigfillset(&newmask);
    sigprocmask(SIG_BLOCK, &newmask, &oldmask);

    if (!insert_after) {
        new_elem->fwd = ll->head;
        ll->head = new_elem;
    } else {
        new_elem->fwd = insert_after->fwd;
        insert_after->fwd = new_elem;
    }

    //recover
    sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK, &oldmask, NULL);
}
```


Of course, like in problem 1, this is only good for protecting against signals, and not actual multithreading or anything of that sort. 

C) Now, modify the code in a different way to make it safe for the MTU case, where multiple threads or processes
are sharing the linked list data structure in shared memory.</br>

We'd have to use the MUTEX functions here, as no function a user creates can ever truly guaruntee multithread safety. 

```c
#include <pthread.h>

struct ll {
    struct ll_elem* head;
    pthread_mutex_t lock;
    /* And potentially other stuff */
};
struct ll_elem {
    struct ll_elem* fwd;
    int payload;
    /* And potentially other stuff */
};

void ll_insert(struct ll* ll, struct ll_elem* insert_after, struct ll_elem* new_elem) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&ll->lock);

    if (!insert_after) {
        new_elem->fwd = ll->head;
        ll->head = new_elem;
    } else {
        new_elem->fwd = insert_after->fwd;
        insert_after->fwd = new_elem;
    }

    pthread_mutex_unlock(&ll->lock);
}
```

We basically lock the list, and unlock the list afterwards. We only really care about ll in this case, as that's the list that will be changing.
